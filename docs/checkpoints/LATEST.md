## Current PDF visual truth

Strategy 1 / Hybrid remains the proven template-overlay strategy for owner-authored Custom sheets.

Para Hoja de PJ Symbols v8 is **OWNER APPROVED / FROZEN**.

### Approved/frozen base sheets

- **Custom v1** — Run 7 final calibrated base sheet approved/frozen.
- **Custom v2 — per Attribute** — Run 4 base sheet approved/frozen.
- **Custom v2 — per Ability** — corrected Run 2 base sheet approved/frozen.
- Shared Custom-v2 pages are frozen as the approved common baseline.

Do not recalibrate these base sheets without a new owner-observed issue.

### Classic D&D-style

Classic is application-designed, not an official-sheet facsimile.

**Classic Run 2 corrected complete family is OWNER APPROVED / FROZEN.**

Approved baseline:

- renderer/proof commit `3dbcff8f5f9a2413f6deb8e400daeb6288b4f6b1`;
- Scaffold push run `35480871986` / run #2793 — SUCCESS;
- nine-page approval set: three normal pages plus all six D-0074 extension roles;
- strict text-overflow and Spanish-only regression guards pass;
- final Y-axis rule: writing lines remain present under prefilled text and text must align within, not collide with, ruled-paper rhythm.

Stable pointer:

`docs/PC_SHEET_CLASSIC_APPROVED_BASELINE.md`

Run 1 is **OWNER REJECTED / historical evidence only** and must not be used as a continuation baseline.

## Extended pages — required for every design

Owner clarification on 2026-09-19 reaffirmed D-0074:

> Extended pages are required for all visual families.

This means:

- Classic must have Classic-styled Extended pages;
- Custom v1 must have Custom-v1-styled Extended pages;
- Custom v2 per Attribute / per Ability must use Custom-v2-coherent Extended pages;
- there is no generic one-style-fits-all Extended appendix.

Applicable extension roles are data-driven and include:

- Custom Statistics;
- Traits & Features;
- Resources & Options;
- Inventory / Equipment;
- Spells;
- Notes.

Base-sheet approval does not by itself close a whole visual family if its required Extended-page design/QA is still pending.

## Current continuation

1. preserve all four approved/frozen visual-family baselines: Custom v1, Custom v2 per Attribute, Custom v2 per Ability and Classic;
2. design/QA the still-pending family-matched Extended pages for **Custom v1 and Custom v2**, without recalibrating their frozen base sheets;
3. promote approved visual mechanics into production renderer paths;
4. complete family/end-to-end export QA and remaining D-0074 behaviors, including data-driven overflow and the separate optional Spellbook;
5. keep PR #85 DRAFT / DO NOT MERGE until the remaining visual/functional gates are satisfied.

No external provider action is required for this PDF-renderer stage.
