This file controls branch lifecycle. Branch existence alone never establishes authority.

## `main`

`main` is the sole normal integrated-MVP trunk and normal continuation point.

PC authority administration validation: corrected push Scaffold `35291183960`, PR Scaffold `35291417403`, post-merge Scaffold `35291685597` — all SUCCESS. Initial push `35290905581` failed on narrow backend row-typing and Kotlin visibility compile issues while the hosted-database contract passed.

Do not restart completed Wave 5, Wave 6, Creature Manager, NPC Manager, Homebrew/Rules Manager, Place/Shop Manager, Stage retrieval, Scene Spine, Dungeon/Zone Manager, Encounter Manager, PC Manager inspection/audit or PC authority repository implementation without new defect evidence.

## Completed implementation branches

Integrated scope belongs to `main`; these refs are not continuation authority.

## Documentation closure branches

Historical/short-lived Wave 7 closure branches:

- `docs/wave7-creature-manager-integrated` — Creature -> NPC;
- `docs/wave7-npc-manager-integrated` — NPC -> Homebrew & Rules;
- `docs/wave7-homebrew-rules-manager-integrated` — Homebrew & Rules -> Place/Shop;
- `docs/wave7-place-shop-manager-integrated` — Place/Shop -> Stage;
- `docs/wave7-stage-manager-integrated` — Stage -> Adventure/Scene Spine;
- `docs/wave7-scene-spine-integrated` — Scene Spine -> Dungeon/Zone Manager;
- `docs/wave7-dungeon-zone-manager-integrated` — Dungeon/Zone Manager -> Encounter Manager / Encounter Creator;
- `docs/wave7-encounter-manager-integrated` — Encounter Manager -> PC Manager / Audit;
- `docs/wave7-pc-manager-audit-integrated` — PC Manager inspection/audit -> ownership/controller administration;
- `docs/wave7-pc-authority-repo-integrated` — authority repository merge -> provider deployment gate;
- `docs/wave7-pc-sheet-pdf-foundation-integrated` — PDF semantic foundation -> physical renderer/template mapping.

After a closure merges, normal implementation starts from current `main`; do not continue coding on a docs branch.

## Current branch direction

The PC Sheet PDF Export shared semantic/render-plan foundation is integrated in PR #83.

The next implementation-ready package is **PC Sheet PDF Export — local renderer + authoritative template mapping** under D-0074.

Expected short-lived branch name:

`wave7/pc-sheet-pdf-renderer-template-proof`

Functional boundary:

- consume the existing shared render plan rather than inventing new PC/export semantics;
- generate static PDF output locally/offline;
- use the owner's actual Custom v1/v2 PDFs as authoritative base pages;
- preserve the v2 page-1 / page-2 alternative mapping already encoded in the shared plan;
- establish concrete field placement/template metadata and rendering primitives;
- add generated/Extended pages only where the approved D-0074 modes require them;
- do not call the visual family approved until the owner has seen a populated dummy-data example.

The Classic family is independently designed. Custom v1/v2 are not to be unnecessarily redrawn from scratch.

Do not invent freeze/unfreeze semantics. D-0072 requires freeze/unfreeze, but current durable records do not define what freezing blocks and there is no existing freeze field/contract.

## Historical/stale open PRs

PR #36 and PR #37 are older Wave 4-era items. They are not current continuation authority. Do not infer current work from their open state.

## Accidental refs

`__noop_should_not_create__` and `__should_not_create__` were verified with no unique project work and are non-authoritative. Safe deletion is optional housekeeping and not a development blocker.

## Operating rule

Routine green branch creation, CI, PR creation, merge and post-merge validation are not separate owner-confirmation gates when scope/risk is unchanged. Continue autonomously until a real owner/product/risk/provider/failure/async-wait boundary appears.
