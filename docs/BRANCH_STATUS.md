# Branch status and repository-ordering map

**Updated:** 2026-09-17 (Chile local time)  
**Owner implementation authorization:** GRANTED  
**Normal integrated trunk:** `main`  
**Last verified runtime merge:** `7000535b78df2b2a7149b019796ff3d5903fdb3d` (PR #75)  
**Post-merge Scaffold:** `35287713130` — SUCCESS  
**Wave 5 lifecycle:** COMPLETE / OWNER-QA ACCEPTED / INTEGRATED  
**Wave 6 core reusable-content lifecycle:** COMPLETE / INTEGRATED  
**Wave 7 lifecycle:** ACTIVE  
**Current normal work:** Encounter Manager documentation closure, then PC Manager / Audit — Desktop inspection/audit core

This file controls branch lifecycle. Branch existence alone never establishes authority.

## `main`

`main` is the sole normal integrated-MVP trunk and normal continuation point.

Encounter Manager validation: corrected push Scaffold `35287257508`, PR Scaffold `35287507268`, post-merge Scaffold `35287713130` — all SUCCESS. Initial push `35286844850` failed only on the corrected Kotlin visibility mismatch.

Do not restart completed Wave 5, Wave 6, Creature Manager, NPC Manager, Homebrew/Rules Manager, Place/Shop Manager, Stage retrieval, Scene Spine, Dungeon/Zone Manager or Encounter Manager implementation without new defect evidence.

## Completed implementation branches

Wave 5 historical branches:

Integrated scope belongs to `main`; these refs are not continuation authority.

## Documentation closure branches

Historical/short-lived Wave 7 closure branches:

- `docs/wave7-creature-manager-integrated` — Creature -> NPC;
- `docs/wave7-npc-manager-integrated` — NPC -> Homebrew & Rules;
- `docs/wave7-homebrew-rules-manager-integrated` — Homebrew & Rules -> Place/Shop;
- `docs/wave7-place-shop-manager-integrated` — Place/Shop -> Stage;
- `docs/wave7-stage-manager-integrated` — Stage -> Adventure/Scene Spine;
- `docs/wave7-scene-spine-integrated` — Scene Spine -> Dungeon/Zone Manager;
- `docs/wave7-dungeon-zone-manager-integrated` — Dungeon/Zone Manager -> Encounter Manager / Encounter Creator;
- `docs/wave7-encounter-manager-integrated` — Encounter Manager -> PC Manager / Audit.

After a closure merges, normal implementation starts from current `main`; do not continue coding on a docs branch.

## Wave 7 next branch direction

The next selected package is **PC Manager / Audit — Desktop inspection/audit core**.

Expected short-lived branch name:

`wave7/desktop-pc-manager-audit-core`

D-0072 requires PC Manager to operate over the same canonical PC records used by Player rather than creating a separate Desktop character model.

Current bounded direction:

- inspect the existing PC persistence, authority, sync and history surfaces before adding schema;
- campaign PC overview/retrieval and complete DM inspection;
- distinguish data freshness from sync freshness where current evidence supports those concepts;
- expose meaningful grouped audit/history already available;
- implement explicit DM correction/edit paths only through preserved-history and authority-safe mechanisms;
- keep campaign membership, PC ownership and PC control separate;
- focused tests around inspection, authority and correction boundaries.

Do not build a second Desktop character-builder, silently impersonate the Player, destructively rewrite history, or conflate DM role with PC ownership/control.

Freeze/unfreeze, lifecycle administration, ownership/controller administration, duplication and PC Sheet PDF export remain approved responsibilities, but should be scheduled from concrete existing architecture rather than speculative parallel models.

Media/Handouts and deferred richer Homebrew families remain later concrete packages.

## Historical/stale open PRs

PR #36 and PR #37 are older Wave 4-era items. They are not current continuation authority. Do not infer current work from their open state.

## Accidental refs

`__noop_should_not_create__` and `__should_not_create__` were verified with no unique project work and are non-authoritative. Safe deletion is optional housekeeping and not a development blocker.

## Operating rule

Routine green branch creation, CI, PR creation, merge and post-merge validation are not separate owner-confirmation gates when scope/risk is unchanged. Continue autonomously until a real owner/product/risk/provider/failure/async-wait boundary appears.
